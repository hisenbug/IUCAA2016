Fortran Code Used for my Bachelor's Thesis: Orbits of a Planet in a Protoplanetary Disk

The code implements 4th order structure preserving symplective method for gravitational forces, extracting surface of section information, and fast forier transform to characterize frequencies in the problem.

The Gnuplot commands to plot the data are included as comments in the code. 

There is a bonus Fortran code which solved the circularly restricted 3 body problem for the Sun-Jupiter-Migrating Planet system.
